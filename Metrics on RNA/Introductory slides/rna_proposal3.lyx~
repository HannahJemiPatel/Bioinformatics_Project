\begin_layout Title
Metrics on RNA secondary structure ensembles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Standard
RNA secondary structure is defined as the set of base-pairing interactions
 between the constituent bases of a RNA sequence.
 The function of a RNA is largely determined by its secondary structure.
 Consequently, if two or more RNAs share a similar secondary structure it
 is likely that they share a similar function.
 There exist various metrics that allow one to measure similarity between
 two RNA secondary structures (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moulton2000metrics"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical assumption made in RNA structure studies is that a particular
 RNA sequence forms a single, well-defined structure, such RNAs are referred
 to as 
\emph on
stable
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
highly structured
\emph default
.
 However, it is more accurate to think of RNA sequences as able to adopt
 a range of possible conformations with varying degrees of probability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "halvorsen2010disease,mathews2004using,bernhart2006partition,waldispuhl2007computing"

\end_inset

.
 RNAs that have a tendency to adopt a large number of distinct conformations
 are termed 
\emph on
flexible
\emph default
.
 The untranslated regions (UTRs) of many mRNAs are generally considered
 to be so 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "halvorsen2010disease"

\end_inset

.
 The probability distribution over all possible structural conformations
 a particular RNA sequence can form under a given set of conditions is referred
 to as its 
\emph on
ensemble
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this project is define a set of metrics that allow one to quantify
 the spread of structural conformations within an ensemble (a measure of
 flexibility) and measure distances between structural ensembles (as opposed
 to just the distance between the most probable conformation in each of
 the two ensembles, as is currently the standard).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These metrics are expected to be applied to real-world data, to test whether
 associations exist between the measured properties of the RNA ensembles
 and different functional annotations.
 For example, ensembles corresponding to mutant sequences which are measured
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

far
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the wild-type ensemble might be associated with disease more frequently
 than can be accounted for by chance.

\begin_layout Standard
Primary objective:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{2}$
\end_inset

 denote structural ensembles corresponding to two sequences, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}_{2}$
\end_inset

, folded under conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{2}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Design two computationally efficient metrics for structural ensembles.The
 first metric, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}(\mathcal{E}_{1})$
\end_inset

, should approximate the within-ensemble variance (partially a proxy of
 structural flexibility).
 The second metric, 
\begin_inset Formula $d(\mathcal{E}_{1},\mathcal{E}_{2})$
\end_inset

 should approximate distances between ensembles and must have the property
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $d(\mathcal{E}_{1},\mathcal{E}_{2})\approx0$
\end_inset

, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{1}=\mathcal{E}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that stochastic sampling of secondary structures from ensembles will
 be used to compute the desired metrics, implying the metrics provide only
 approximate answers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possible tasks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Introduction to computer representations of RNA secondary structure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Understand the difference between thermodynamic and SCFG approaches to RNA
 secondary structure prediction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Read 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moulton2000metrics"

\end_inset

 - describes various metrics for measuring distances between RNA secondary
 structures (not ensembles!).
 You should focus on understanding the mountain metric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Read 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "halvorsen2010disease"

\end_inset

 - motivates why structural ensembles are useful to consider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Before computing the desired statistics, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}(\mathcal{E}_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d(\mathcal{E}_{1},\mathcal{E}_{2})$
\end_inset

, you need to be able to generate statistically representative samples (RNA
 secondary structures) from RNA ensembles.
 There are multiple approaches to sampling (we recommend using the first
 approach):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Use ViennaRNA's RNAsubopt to stochastically draw samples with probability
 proportional to their Boltzmann weights.
 Requires programmatically shelling to the RNAsubopt executable.
 Thermodynamic only.
 For example, the following command: 
\family typewriter
RNAsubopt.exe --stochBT=1000 --temp=37.0 < input_seq.fas > output_sample.txt
\family default
, will take as input a sequence, fold it at 37.0C and generate a sample of
 1000 secondary structures from the folded ensemble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implement a MCMC algorithm to sample from either a thermodynamic or SCFG
 ensemble.
 Requires designing valid proposadl between RNA secondary structures.
 Will likely require implementing a parallel tempering algorithm due to
 the multi-modal nature of RNA ensembles.
 Has the disadvantage that it will be slow and samples are dependent (auto-corre
lated).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sample using inside-outside probabilities.
 For SCFGs only, programmatically difficult, but will generate independent
 samples.
 Is the SCFG analogue of RNAsubopt's stochastic traceback.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}(\mathcal{E}_{i})$
\end_inset

 against different values of temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 for a single sequence.
 We expect ensemble variance to be positively correlated with temperature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As a test case, compute distances using the ensemble distance metric between
 a wild-type RNA ensemble and single-nucleotide mutant disease-associated
 RNA ensembles.
 Test whether ensemble distance from the wildtype ensemble correlates with
 disease-association, one way to do this is to randomly generating mutant
 sequences that all differ from the wild-type by exactly one nucleotide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Benchmark 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}(\mathcal{E}_{1})$
\end_inset

 against known stable RNA structures and known flexible RNA structures.
 Flexible structures are expected to have higher 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}(\mathcal{E}_{1})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform a PCA analysis in order to visualise secondary structure ensembles
 in 2D, as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Generate samples from the wild-type 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{w}$
\end_inset

 and mutant ensembles: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{E}_{1},\ldots,\mathcal{E}_{m}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compute mountain vectors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moulton2000metrics"

\end_inset

 for each sample in each ensemble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform a seperate PCA analysis for each of the ensembles.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A comparison of ensembles generated via the two different approaches (thermodyna
mic vs.
 SCFGs).
 Relies on being able to sample from both thermodynamic and SCFG ensembles,
 as described in 6).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Long-term objectives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform a large scale analysis of human RNAs, and test whether flexible
 structures (as measured using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}(\mathcal{E}_{1})$
\end_inset

) are associated with certain functional annotations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Develop a robust and computationally efficient method for pairwise alignment
 of RNA structural ensembles.
 This would be particularly valuable, as alignment becomes necessary when
 comparing two structural ensembles corresponding to two RNA sequences of
 differing length.
 This would eventually be expected to be applied on a genome-wide scale
